## Exam Instructions

*Save your boss*

*It is a Thursday afternoon in the Drieloitte office, 17.46 to be precise. As it was a busy week, you are about to pack your stuff and have a beer with a few  friends. But then your boss walks towards you, slightly panicking. That doesn’t look good, you think to yourself. “I need you to do a data analysis right now” he says. “We promised our very important client Woogle to have their data explored and analysed by this morning. Now, our best Data Scientist Ben quit his job this morning! We didn’t know what to do but then I remember you did this awesome Data Science course with Python. Can you please help us out??”*

*For a moment, you think about your beer in the pub, and the struggles this challenge will bring you. But then, you turn around and say with a determined voice: “Let’s explore that dataset.”*

You can choose between 4 datasets;

[Credit Risk Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/karanagarwal/bankloans)
[Premier League Info](https://www.kaggle.com/lynuhs/premier-league-19922017)
[Yelp](https://www.kaggle.com/anupam99/review)

The Kaggle Survey dataset used in Session 5

Your task is to pick one of the above datasets and load it in ( kaggle / colab / jupyter notebook ). And do a data analysis where you explore the most important features of the dataset. Make sure that you visualise what you find and also interpret it (i.e. explain your findings).

We will pay attention to the techniques you use, libraries, whether you comment your code, and explain what you are doing. You are free to use any resources on the internet, such as the notebooks from the sessions, and stackoverflow. And remember, be creative. You want to show the skills you have learned in the last two weeks.

**Bonus ( only if you have time left )**

Remember the creative challenge from session 3?

Here you can create any type of class you want! The only criteria are that your class needs is use;

one parent class
two child classes
4 attributes
3 methods
inheritance
#End of the exam


Happy coding and good luck!*

## Feedback :)

Sorry, feedback is closed!

## Where to go from here

I believe that to improve your coding skills, you need some type of goal or project that makes sure you will keep coding.
There are many great resources out there, here I will provide you with some tips and resources that will set you up for success.

### Case I - I want to improve my algorithmic thinking / logic

Then [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) is for you. Codewars is a platform full of short challenges called "katas". They are sorted by difficulty and cover various topics such as logic, algortihms, math, games and more. As you get points per solved kata, it is addicting! Another cool feature is that you get to see other people's solutions after solving the problem. 

### Case II - I want to apply Python for my thesis / other project

The best way is to just start. Of course you will get stuck, but you are (almost) never the only one with a problem. You just need motivation, time and stackoverflow.
But if you like to work with a book, I'd recommend [automate the boring stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)

### Case III - I want to do Machine Learning / Data Science 

Obviously Bletchley starts in February, but if for one reason or another you are not able to join, these are the recommendations;

- 1. [Do a Course in ML / DL](https://digitaldefynd.com/best-machine-learning-and-deep-learning-courses/)
- 2. Make a Kaggle account and start participating in competitions. Apply your knowledge!

On a final note; if you want to do a project, collect a group of people that are interested as well. This way you make sure you will stick to your goals and frankly retain more information. Other people will always ask different questions than you.
