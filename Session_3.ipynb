        "Python is an object-oriented programming language, which means it manipulates programming constructs called objects. You can think of an object as a single data structure that contains data as well as functions; the functions of an object are called its methods. A class is just a way of organizing and producing objects with similar attributes and methods. \n",

        "\n",
        "Python is an **imperative programming language**, just like Ruby, C, C++ and Java to name a few.\n",
        "OOP is based on the imperative programming paradigm. \n",
        "\n",
        "The definition of a paradigm is \"a typical example or pattern of something; a pattern or model.'' So programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based on their characteristics. \n",

        "\n",
        "Unlike Declarative Paradigms, in which the programmer only vaguely describes what the goal is, in imperative programming languages the programmer precisely instructs the machine how to change its state. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Object Oriented** programming falls in the imperative programming languages category. OOP is all about creating code patterns that can be reused. \n",
        "You can think of it as recycling, but then with code. \n",
        "When you are working on larger coding projects with abstract data structures, it is very important to keep your code as efficient and readable as possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "This idea about creating reusable code is known as **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself).\n",

        "*\"Objects are like people. They’re living, breathing things that have knowledge inside them about how to do things and have memory inside them so they can remember things. And rather than interacting with them at a very low level, you interact with them at a very high level of abstraction, like we’re doing right here.*\n",
        "\n",
        "*Here’s an example: If I’m your laundry object, you can give me your dirty clothes and send me a message that says, “Can you get my clothes laundered, please.” I happen to know where the best laundry place in San Francisco is. And I speak English, and I have dollars in my pockets. So I go out and hail a taxicab and tell the driver to take me to this place in San Francisco. I go get your clothes laundered, I jump back in the cab, I get back here. I give you your clean clothes and say, “Here are your clean clothes.”*\n",
        "\n",
        "*You have no idea how I did that. You have no knowledge of the laundry place. Maybe you speak French, and you can’t even hail a taxi. You can’t pay for one, you don’t have dollars in your pocket. Yet, I knew how to do all of that. And you didn’t have to know any of it. All that **complexity was hidden inside of me**, and we were able to interact at a very high level of abstraction. That’s what objects are. They encapsulate complexity, and the interfaces to that complexity are high level.\" *\n",
